                The treatment of farm animals is the world’s biggest animal welfare issue –<br>
                and it’s getting bigger. By 2050, livestock production will be twice what it was in 2000. Right now, <br>
                more than 70 billion animals are farmed for food each year – two-thirds in conditions that mean they can’t move freely or live naturally. <br>
                We campaign for progress at every stage – from farming to transportation to slaughter.<br>
               And we know change is possible – since 2009, <br>
               our humane slaughter training has made life better for eight billion animals.

    <p> We find the most effective ways to protect animals in communities – and then we act.<br>
         So we help governments to manage dog populations humanely and to vaccinate against rabies, instead of culling dogs. <br>
         We share advice on responsible pet ownership. <br>
         We prevent working animals being overworked and abused.<br>
          We do whatever is necessary to protect animals in communities worldwide.    
</p>

    <p>Throughout our history, our supporters have campaigned to make life better for animals – persuading governments, <br>
        international bodies, companies, communities and individuals to get serious about protecting animals. <br>
        Thanks to our supporters, we’ve made life better for billions of animals. <br>
        We’ve stopped animal cruelty around the world. <br>
        And we continue to speak up and speak out every day – with support from people like you, who know that change is always possible.

   <p>We’ve been moving the world to protect bears for more than 20 years. <br>
    In India, Turkey and Greece, we’ve helped to end bear dancing – for good.
